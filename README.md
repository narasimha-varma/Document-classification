**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
===============

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models primarily used for analyzing visual data. Unlike regular neural networks, CNNs are designed to take advantage of the 2D structure of images. They use a specialized kind of layer called convolutional layers.

### Key Concepts

1. **Input Layer**
   - The input layer holds the raw pixel values of the image. For instance, an image of size 28x28 with a single color channel (grayscale) will have the dimensions [28x28x1].

2. **Convolutional Layer (CONV)**
   - This layer applies a convolution operation to the input, passing the result to the next layer. Convolution is a linear operation that involves the multiplication of a set of weights with the input. 
   - The output of a convolutional layer is called a feature map, which represents the activation of different features detected in the input.

3. **ReLU Layer**
   - The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) layer applies an element-wise activation function such as max(0, x) to introduce non-linearity into the model. 
   - The ReLU function replaces all negative pixel values in the feature map by zero.

4. **Pooling Layer**
   - Pooling layers perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width and height), reducing the dimensions of the feature map.
   - Common types of pooling include max pooling (which takes the maximum value in each patch of each feature map) and average pooling.

5. **Fully-Connected Layer (FC)**
   - After several convolutional and pooling layers, the high-level reasoning in the neural network is done via fully connected layers.
   - These layers have connections to all activations in the previous layer, and their neurons compute class scores, resulting in a volume of size [1x1xN], where N is the number of classes.

### Example Architecture

- **Input Layer:** [28x28x1] 
- **Convolutional Layer:** 12 filters of size 5x5, output [28x28x12]
- **ReLU Layer:** Activation function applied, output [28x28x12]
- **Pooling Layer:** 2x2 max pooling, output [14x14x12]
- **Convolutional Layer:** 24 filters of size 5x5, output [14x14x24]
- **ReLU Layer:** Activation function applied, output [14x14x24]
- **Pooling Layer:** 2x2 max pooling, output [7x7x24]
- **Fully-Connected Layer:** 128 neurons, output [1x1x128]
- **ReLU Layer:** Activation function applied
- **Fully-Connected Layer:** 10 neurons, output [1x1x10] (assuming 10 classes)

### Implementation Example

Here is a simple implementation in Python using a deep learning library like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

#### TensorFlow Example

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

model = models.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Conv2D(12, (5, 5), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(24, (5, 5), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Flatten())
model.add(layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

model.summary()
